# Tektalk on *Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models*

This directory contains notes and code to help us work through Gelman & Hill's 2007 book *Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models*. This is a collaborative effort and we hope everything is correct. That being said, we are all busy so it's likely we may have missed some things! We welcome constructive feedback :)
